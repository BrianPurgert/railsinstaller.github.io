We are excited to announce the first alpha release of RailsInstaller V4, fully updated to the latest versions of Rails and Ruby, with a pre-configured SQLite database.

- Ruby 3.1.2
- Rails 7.0.4

- pre-configured SQLite

Please note that this release is only available for the 64-bit version, and you will need to download and install git, node, and yarn before installing RailsInstaller.

If you encounter any issues, please open an issue on GitHub. We welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing to improve RailsInstaller.
